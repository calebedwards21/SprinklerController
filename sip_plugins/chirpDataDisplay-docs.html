   <p> 
    All sensor readings utilize MQTT protocol for sending polled sensor data from ESP32's
    (publisher) to our raspberry pi controller (subscriber) which are than stored using
    InfluxDB (time-series data base).

   <h3>Weekly Weather</h3>
   We created a Weather Scraper script in Python to pull weather data from Google for the next five days (including today)
   which is displayed on chirpDataDisplay page.
   
   *NOTE: You must have internet connection for scraping real time weather.
   <h3>BME Station Readings</h3>
    <p>
    A BME 680 along with an ESP32 as a microcontroller is used for capturing barometric pressure,
    temperature and humidity. We use pressure and humidity along with scraped weather to help us gauge
    whether or not it is going to rain. See the following link for more information plus a tutorial for setting up
    a bme680.
