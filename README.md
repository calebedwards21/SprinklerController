# SprinklerController
This branch contains the I2C Chirp Soil Sensor implemented in Arduino IDE. I was unable to get it working using Micropythong, but Caleb was able to.
I am pushing this code as temp to be used if we want to switch over to Arduino IDE.
Everything is working except that the ESP32 is unable to succesfully connecto the the MQTT Broker installed on a raspberry pi.
